  "title": "What Are False Credit Card Declines?",
  "summary": "False declines occur when valid credit card transactions are mistakenly rejected, preventing customers from making purchases. These mischaracterizations can significantly impact revenue, with estimates suggesting a high percentage of flagged transactions are actually legitimate. Understanding the decision-making process involving issuer processors and issuers is crucial for addressing these declines.",
