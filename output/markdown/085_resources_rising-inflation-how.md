# Rising Inflation: How to Keep Subscribers during Economic Uncertainties
Keeping customers happy when budgets are stretched
## Summary
Inflation is rising at the fastest pace since the 1980s. In March 2022, adjusted consumer prices jumped 8.5%, rising from 7.9% in February. This continues the ongoing trend of new 40-year inflation highs that have been building for the past 5 months.
While subscription businesses have thrived and grown during the pandemic, new strategies are needed to adjust to changes in the economy, strengthen customer trust, and reduce churn.
**During this 20 minute webinar youâ€™ll learn:**
  * Simple ways to improve retention
  * The benefits of rewards for brand loyalty
  * The importance of pricing flexibility
  * How to reduce payment friction
