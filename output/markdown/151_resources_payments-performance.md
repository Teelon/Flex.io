# Payments Performance: Aligning Subscription Payments Measurements With Revenue
# Payment Performance: Aligning Subscription Payments Measurements With Revenue
**Abstract:**
If you’re still using authorization rates to measure payment performance, you may be missing the bigger picture—especially if you run a subscription-based business.
While authorization rate is a useful metric for eCommerce, it falls short when applied to recurring billing. That’s because changes in approval rates don’t always translate to changes in revenue.
This webinar explains why traditional metrics often lead to the wrong conclusions and introduces a more accurate way to measure how well your payment system is performing, using real-world examples to show the revenue impact.
**Why You Should Watch**
Many businesses use the wrong metrics to evaluate payment performance, resulting in misaligned strategies and missed revenue opportunities. In this session, you’ll learn how a smarter, more meaningful KPI can help you:
  * Increase revenue and subscriber LTV
  * Better align performance tracking with business goals
  * Move beyond ineffective metrics to what actually drives growth  



**What You’ll Learn**
✅ Why authorization rate doesn’t tell the full story for subscription companies
✅ How a new performance metric can give you better insight into payment success
✅ A real-world example showing how this new approach led to improved results
✅ How to apply this insight to your own business
