The FlexPay name and logo are trademarks of FlexPay, and no license or right is granted to you to use them.
## Confidentiality
As used in this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means information and materials provided by the disclosing Party (“Discloser”) to the Party receiving such information or materials (“Recipient”) that (a) are identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, or (b) a reasonable person in the relevant industries should understand to be confidential based on the nature of the information and materials and all other relevant factors. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer’s Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the Customer Data and Customer’s non-public business plans, and FlexPay ’s Confidential Information includes, without limitation, all pricing terms offered to Customer under any Order Form, FlexPay ’s non-public business plans, all non-public aspects of the FlexPay Technology, and the results of any evaluation of the Service performed by or on behalf of Customer for purposes of monitoring its availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes.
Recipient must not use any of Discloser’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than carrying out Recipient’s obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement (the “Purpose”). For the avoidance of doubt, use of Confidential Information in an aggregated and anonymized manner that does not include personally identifiable information and/or personal information is not prohibited.
Recipient also must not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information, other than to Recipient’s Affiliates, contractors and consultants who (a) need to know such information in order to fulfill the Purpose, and (b) are bound by confidentiality obligations substantially similar to Recipient’s under this Agreement (each Party is fully responsible for its respective Affiliates’, contractors’ and consultants’ compliance with this Agreement). Recipient must treat all Discloser Confidential Information with the same degree of care Recipient gives to its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care. Further, neither Party may disclose publicly the existence or nature of any negotiations, discussions or consultations in progress between the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party. Recipient and its Affiliates, contractors and consultants who receive Confidential Information hereunder must: (i) not use any such Confidential Information to compete with Discloser or in any other way except as reasonably necessary for the Purpose; (ii) not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects received from Discloser under this Agreement that embody Confidential Information; (iii) promptly notify Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes aware; and (iv) reasonably assist Discloser in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure.
Recipient’s obligations under this section will not apply to any Discloser Confidential Information that Recipient can prove: (a) is or becomes part of in the public domain through no fault of Recipient; (b) is rightfully in Recipient’s possession free of any confidentiality obligation; (c) was independently developed by Recipient without use of any Discloser Confidential Information; or (d) is communicated by Discloser to an unaffiliated third party free of any confidentiality obligation. A disclosure by Recipient of any Confidential Information (i) in response to a valid order or other legal process issued by a court or other governmental body having jurisdiction, (ii) as otherwise required by law, or (iii) necessary to establish the rights of either Party under this Agreement will not be a breach of this Agreement if, to the extent legally permitted, Recipient gives Discloser prompt notice and reasonable cooperation so Discloser may seek to prevent or limit such disclosure.
As between Discloser and Recipient, all Discloser Confidential Information is the property of Discloser, and no license or other rights are granted or implied hereby. All materials provided to Recipient by Discloser, whether or not they contain or disclose Confidential Information, are Discloser’s property. Promptly after any request by Discloser, Recipient will (a) destroy or return to Discloser all Confidential Information and materials in Recipient’s possession or control, and (b) upon written request by Discloser, confirm such return/destruction in writing; provided, however, that the Recipient may retain electronic copies of any computer records or electronic files containing any Discloser Confidential Information that have been created pursuant to Recipient’s standard, commercially reasonable archiving and backup practices, as long as Recipient continues to comply with this Agreement with respect to such electronic backup copies for so long as such Confidential Information is retained.
Exchange of Confidential Information under this Agreement is subject to all applicable export laws and regulations. Except to the extent permitted by a separate agreement, the Parties will not disclose any information requiring an authorization to be exported.
Recipient’s obligations with respect to Discloser’s Confidential Information under this section will remain in effect for the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years after any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
## PCI Compliance
We will maintain PCI DSS compliance against the current version of PCI DSS published on the PCI Security Standards Council website. Within the limitations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, we shall be responsible for the security of cardholder data that we possess, including functions relating to storage, processing, and transmission of the cardholder data. We will immediately notify you if we learn that we are no longer PCI DSS compliant and will notify you of steps being taken to remedy the non-compliance status. In no event, shall FlexPay’s notification be later than fourteen (14) calendar days after We learn We are no longer PCI DSS compliant.
## Service Downtimes
FlexPay continuously upgrades the relevant hardware and software components associated to deliver a highly secure service to the Users. In the event of such modifications, FlexPay will plan for scheduled downtimes of its services and notify Users accordingly. The notifications will be through emails and dashboard URL.
## Service Upgrades and Support 
FlexPay services may include certain third party components and support services. Users shall adhere to the terms and conditions of such third-party providers, where clearly indicated, in addition to the terms of service of FlexPay. FlexPay liability is limited to the data stored in its own servers and does not extend coverage to the third-party components and services.
## Miscellaneous
If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
You hereby consent to FlexPay publicizing the existence (but not the terms) of the relationship contemplated hereunder as a part of promotional and marketing activities from time to time by FlexPay.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between FlexPay and you with respect to your use of the FlexPay Site, Materials, Content, Services, and your Account, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between FlexPay and you with respect thereto.
The failure of FlexPay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
