# How to Create Short-Term Gains in Subscriber LTV
# How to Create Short-Terms Gains in Subscriber LTV
Guaranteed methods to reduce customer churn and increase customer satisfaction and lifetime value
Did you know that there is a direct relationship between the payment experience of your subscribers and how long they stay subscribed?
Subscription companies are customer-obsessed and invest heavily in delivering a great product and customer support experience. Yet, one of the largest drivers of subscriber churn, your subscriber’s payments experience, is often not given the same attention. 
FlexPay’s Darryl Hicks and Optimized Payments’ Sharon Gross will:
  * Analyze the payments experience,
  * Identify the common problems that harm it and what that costs your business,
  * Understand where in their subscriber’s payment experience to focus for short-term LTV (lifetime value) gains.


Viewers will understand the roadmap for how their subscription company can upgrade their payments stack, improve their payments experience, and reduce the customer churn caused by it.
