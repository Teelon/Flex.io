# FlexPay and PYMNTS release State of Subscription Business: Best Practices and Business Performance Drivers Report 
MONTREAL, Jan. 10, 2023 /CNW Telbec/ – FlexPay, the leading global payments and technology company, and PYMNTS, the leader in data and insights on the payments industry, today released key findings from _The_ 2023 _State of Subscription Business_ report. This report, which gathered feedback from a survey of 200 subscription companies, provides the first comprehensive overview of the subscription industry. 
The report provides unique insights into key trends and best practices that are vital for all companies with recurring billing models to understand. Actionable recommendations are identified that subscription companies can implement to improve operational efficiency, increase customer retention, and accelerate revenue growth, which have never been more vital as many companies are dealing with a slowdown in new customer growth. 
##  **Subscription Industry Sentiment over the Next 12 Months**
The _State of Subscription Business: Best Practices and Business Performance Drivers_ highlights the top challenges subscription businesses expect to face in the next 12 months, with 59% citing economic downturn, followed closely by growing challenges in attracting and retaining customers, and lastly, cost increases from growing inflation.
##  **Best Practices of Top Performing Subscription Companies**
The report also identifies critical findings that correlate with high-performing subscription companies, including: 
  * Top metrics subscription companies use to align operating teams and improve financial results 
  * The importance of measuring and managing lifetime value (LTV) to improve profitability and why this important metric is not used widely 


  * Problems in the payment systems that cause customer churn and strategies companies can use to overcome them 
  * The organizational structure that correlates with top-performing subscription businesses 


According to Steve Arentzoff, Senior Vice President of Marketing at FlexPay, “The subscription industry has lacked a comprehensive view of the state of the industry. This report is an important resource for subscription companies to learn about best practices that every company can implement, which can improve operational efficiencies, and lead to accelerated revenue growth and higher profitability.” 
The report can be accessed [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3752307-1&h=55891215&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftrust.flexpay.io%2Fthe-state-of-subscription-business-report%3Futm_source%3DPaid_Display%26utm_medium%3DCision%26utm_campaign%3DFY23_Q1_TheStateofSubscriptionBusiness_FP-PYMNTS_report&a=here). 
##  **Survey Methodology**
_The State Of Subscription Business: Best Practices And Business Performance Drivers_ report is based on aggregated and anonymized data from two hundred executive decision-makers at companies that offer subscription-based services and products. The businesses generated 40% or more of their revenue from subscription relationships and reported annual revenues of $100 million and above. The report, including the insights and analysis contained within it, was prepared by PYMNTS with the support of FlexPay.
