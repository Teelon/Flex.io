**Sensitive Personal Data** , such as proof of vaccination or race and ethnicity (optional) (where permissible under applicable law). | Not applicable  
Although we have not “sold” or “shared” personal data for money in the past 12 months, we engage in routine practices with our Digital Properties involving third parties that could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” as defined under California law. We do not knowingly sell or share any personal data of minors under the age of 16. We do not collect or process “sensitive personal information,” as defined by California law, to infer characteristics about you. FlexPay only uses sensitive personal information consistent with the exceptions to the right to limit sensitive personal information.
**Financial Incentives:** We may offer a benefit or offering in exchange for you providing personal data, such as a discount or coupon to individuals who respond to a survey. As part of these surveys we may collect personal data, such as your name, contact information, preferences, experiences, beliefs, opinions, and other responses to the survey questions. Participation in surveys is governed by the applicable terms and conditions for the survey, which will describe any financial incentives associated with that survey and how to participate. The value of your data is the value of the offer presented to you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit. You may withdraw from any financial incentive at any time by emailing us at privacy@flexpay.io If we offer another type of financial incentive, we will share with you the material terms of each offer when we ask you to participate.
**b. Your Data Protection Rights:** Subject to legal limitations, certain California residents may have the below rights.
  * **Right to Know.** You have the right to request information about the categories of personal data we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the personal data, the purposes for collecting the personal data, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your personal data, and the purpose for which we disclosed your personal data. You may also request information about the specific pieces of personal data we have collected about you (“Specific Pieces Report”).
  * **Right to Delete.** You have the right to request that we delete personal data that we have collected from you.
  * **Right to Correct.** You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you.
  * **Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.** We do not sell personal data to third parties in exchange for money. However, as we explain in Section 5, we share information with advertising partners and allow advertising partners to collect information from our Digital Properties. This exchange may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under California law, and you have the right to opt out of this “sale” or “sharing” of personal data.


California residents may request to exercise the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, and the Right to Correct by emailing us at privacy@flexpay.io. We will not discriminate against you, in any manner prohibited by applicable law, for exercising these rights.
**How to Fully Exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing:** In order to fully exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing with respect to any “sale” or “sharing” of information, you must undertake both of the following steps:
  1. Submit a Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request by emailing us at  _privacy@flexpay.io_; and
  2. Disable the use of advertising cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our website footer. You must complete this step on each of our Sites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signaling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use.


If you block cookies, we will be unable to comply with your Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request for device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. If you clear the cookies in your browser, you will need to follow Step 2 above again. To the extent required by California law, we will honour “Do Not Sell or Share” opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly-used and recognized by businesses at the browser level, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object.
**Verification:** To process California data protection requests, we will need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request. In most cases, we will request information about you, which may include your name, email address, or other information. If you submit a Right to Know – Specific Pieces Report we may also request a signed declaration, under penalty of perjury, that you are who you say you are. We may request alternative information under certain circumstances and/or use third parties to help verify your identity.
**Authorized Agents:** Authorized agents may exercise California data protection rights on behalf of California individuals, but we reserve the right to verify the individual’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us by submitting a request by emailing us at  _privacy@flexpay.io_ and indicate that they are submitting the request as an agent. We may require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on your behalf by providing signed permission from you. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
**Timing:** We will process Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing requests within fifteen (15) business days from the date we received the request. We will respond to Requests to Delete and Requests to Know within forty-five (45) days unless we need more time, in which case we will notify you, and it may take up to ninety (90) days to respond to your request.

  * **Right to Refuse or Withdraw Consent.** In case we ask for your consent to process your personal data, you are free to refuse to give it. If you have given your consent, you may withdraw it at any time without any adverse consequences. The lawfulness of any processing of your personal data that occurred prior to the withdrawal of your consent will not be affected.
  * **Right to Not Be Subject to Automated Decision-making.** The types of automated decision-making referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) do not take place in connection with your personal data. Should this change, we will inform you about why and how any such decision was made, the significance of it, and the possible consequences of it. You will also have the right to human intervention, to express your point of view, and to contest the decision.


You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the details provided in Section 12 to submit your request. Please note that we may refuse to act on requests to exercise data protection rights in certain cases, such as where providing access might infringe someone else’s privacy rights or impact our legal obligations.
