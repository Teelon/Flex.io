# FlexPay Partners with ROI Solutions to Reduce Involuntary Churn for Nonprofit Organizations 
MONTREAL, Sept. 17, 2024 – FlexPay and ROI Solutions, a leading provider of purpose-built solutions for nonprofit organizations, have partnered to solve failed payments and involuntary sustainer churn for nonprofit organizations. 
The partnership is driven by a shared vision to reduce the problem of involuntary sustainer churn caused by false declines. Nonprofit organizations rely on payment authorizations from their sustainers but face an average 9% decline rate on legitimate recurring payments.
ROI Solutions’ clients will now be able to use their existing Revolution CRM product to access FlexPay’s failed payment recovery platform, which combines AI-powered recovery processes with behavioral science-powered customer engagement programs to deliver the highest declined card payment recovery rate.
“Partnering with FlexPay was an obvious choice for us,” said Cindy Hickman, Senior Director of Product at ROI Solutions. “By integrating FlexPay into Revolution CRM, we can help nonprofits solve one of the largest sources of sustainer churn they face and deliver increased financial efficiency. At ROI Solutions, we care deeply about sustainer retention and satisfaction. We now help our clients avoid involuntary churn through Flexpay, and voluntary churn with our MiLo Intelligence loyalty scores, delivering a seamless payment experience while increasing vital supporter revenue streams.”
“The FlexPay team is thrilled to provide our solution to ROI Solutions and their nonprofit clients to help them better achieve their missions,” commented Ray Watson, SVP of Partnerships at FlexPay. “This integration enables seamless data processing and swift recovery of failed transactions from the sustainers committed to supporting the causes that matter to them.” 
Cindy Hickman added, “Our clients are eager to implement FlexPay’s failed payment recovery solution. They recognize the platform’s immense value in reducing churn and increasing donation revenue for their organizations.”
