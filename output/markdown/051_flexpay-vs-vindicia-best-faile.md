# FlexPay versus Vindicia
Choosing the best failed payment recovery solution is about more than just technology — it’s about maximizing results. FlexPay is designed to recover the most revenue by intervening early with intelligent, AI-driven optimization. In contrast, Vindicia is typically deployed after other attempts have failed, focusing on late-stage transactions with limited remaining value. Clients who switch to FlexPay see an average of 136% increase in recovery. 
Better results start with better timing.

## Details
#### Core AI technology for recovery
Leverages the latest technology appropriate for complex pattern-recognition and decision-making within the payments ecosystem.
FlexPay is a specialized solution that recovers failed payments using AI technology. Vindicia claims to use AI but relies mostly on static retry rules.
#### Transaction data availability
Reflects a mature approach by ensuring high data availability for machine learning training, sourced from diverse merchants and issuers.
FlexPay has trained 25+ ML models using over 11B transactions from merchants across all major verticals and issuing banks.
#### Diverse recovery methods
Depending on the cause of the failed payment, the best recovery method is chosen to address the root cause of the decline.
FlexPay achieves top recovery results by supplementing its AI with data enhancements, account updater, and customer outreach.
#### Recovery rules and regulations
Technology that safeguards the health of the merchant account by adhering to industry best practices.
FlexPay’s recovery technology protects the merchant account health, whereas Vindicia’s forced deposits increase your risk profile.
## FlexPay is the only future-proof choice
The problem with forced deposits
Forced deposits are used as a quick way to recover a payment, however, this practice comes at a cost, including a lower approval rate and increased chargeback rates.
