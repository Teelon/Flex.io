# Top 5 Payment Challenges and Solutions
# Top 5 Failed Payment Challenges and Solutions
**Abstract:**
Failed payments are more than a minor inconvenience – they can cost businesses millions in lost revenue, customer churn, and reduced profitability. Yet, solving the problem isn’t as simple as retrying transactions. Banks, fraud protections, and evolving payment rules all create barriers to successful recovery. 
Hosted by Steve Arentzoff, SVP of Marketing at FlexPay, and Ray Watson, SVP of Channel Partnerships, at FlexPay, this discussion will break down the real challenges behind failed payments and what you can do to fix them. 
**Watch this webinar to learn more about these critical insights:  
  
****The Top 5 Pain Points Caused by Failed Payments**
  * Revenue losses impacting your bottom line 


  * Increased subscriber churn due to payment failures 


  * Decreased Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) 


  * Lower overall company profitability 


  * The pressure to acquire more new subscribers just to maintain growth


**Why Failed Payment Recovery is Harder Than It Seems**
  * 25,000+ issuing banks using different logic for approving or declining payments 


  * The need to balance recovery, retention, and customer satisfaction 


  * Increasing fraud rates and a rapidly evolving payment landscape 


**Why Specialized Recovery Solutions Work Best**
  * Failed payments require data-driven, AI-powered solutions that merchants don’t have access to 


  * Mastercard and Visa are updating rules, penalizing excessive retry attempts 


  * Issuers constantly change their approval logic, requiring real-time adaptation
