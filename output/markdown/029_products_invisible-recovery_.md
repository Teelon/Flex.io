# Recovered revenue calculator
## FlexPay Invisible Recovery™ delivers sustained growth in annual revenue and active customers
Subscription businesses often don’t understand the true economic cost failed payments cause by creating unnecessary customer churn. Conversely, the full economic value of customers recovered following failed payments is underestimated because the full LTV recovered customers is not calculated. Calculate the estimated 12-month revenue gains that Invisible Recovery™ can deliver for your subscription business, regardless of whether an failed payment recovery solution is in place or not. In addition, the Recovery Calculator provides critical forecasts for the growth in active subscription customers your business can enjoy, and the increased customer LTV value that Invisible Recovery™ delivers to subscription businesses from recovered customers.
Calculate revenue Growth
#### Merchant account health
Some failed payment solutions aggressively resubmit failed payments in ways that may temporarily increase recovery results. However, aggressive recovery tactics can increase merchant account risk factors, leading to higher rates, fines, and even account cancellation. Here are some examples of recovery tactics to avoid that can increase merchant account risk factors.
  * Forced capture or forced deposits is a practice that resubmits payments requests on accounts where the pre-authorization was declined, or re-using another pre-authorization to break a payment into smaller pieces
  * Resubmitting transactions with hard declines


### FlexPay maximizes failed payment recovery while avoiding recovery methods that threaten merchant account health. Plus, the FlexPay Invisible Recovery™ solution does not increase chargeback rates.
Invisible Recovery™ works so fast and effectively that, as far as the customer knows,   
the failed payment never happened​
