[](https://flexpay.io/blog/inside-a-failed-transaction-why-they-happen-and-how-you-can-prevent-them/)
For subscription and SaaS businesses, revenue depends on one thing: successful payments. Every failed transaction represents not just a missed opportunity, but a potential customer lost for good. While many companies focus heavily on acquiring new users, the real opportunity for growth lies in reducing preventable payment failures. This article explains why credit card payments […]

Billing platforms manage transactions. Specialized recovery platforms rescue the ones that fail. Learn why the difference matters to your bottom line. Failed payments are one of the most overlooked causes of lost revenue in subscription businesses and have a huge impact on customer churn—more than 50% of involuntary churn is driven by payment failures, not […]

Do-it-yourself strategies may seem like a good way to save money, but they can’t solve the complex issues behind payment failures Failed payments are a hidden but serious threat to subscription businesses. Every unsuccessful transaction represents more than just a lost payment—it can lead to involuntary churn, damaged customer trust, and missed revenue opportunities. In […]

If your business takes credit card payments online, there’s an important update you need to know about. On April 1, 2025, Visa launched a new set of rules called VAMP, which is short for Visa Acquirer Monitoring Program. These rules are designed to help stop fraud, but they also mean stricter rules for businesses like […]

[](https://flexpay.io/blog/why-authorization-rate-isnt-enough/)
If you run a subscription business, you probably keep a close eye on your authorization rate—the percentage of payment attempts that get approved by card issuers. It’s one of the most commonly used metrics to assess how well your payment system is performing. But what if we told you that this number, on its own, […]

Artificial intelligence (AI) is shaking up the payments industry, making fraud detection, customer authentication, and failed payment recovery smarter and more efficient. While AI opens new doors for businesses and financial institutions, it also introduces fresh challenges, like evolving fraud tactics and complex regulations. How AI Works in Payments AI mimics human intelligence, allowing machines […]

Subscription-based businesses have a big problem that often goes unnoticed: false declines caused by card issuers. While merchant fraud teams focus heavily on stopping fraud and managing chargebacks, they frequently miss another critical issue—legitimate payments being wrongly declined. These false declines not only result in lost revenue but also drive involuntary churn, which can significantly […]

The start of a new year is the perfect time to tackle lingering challenges that impact your bottom line. For subscription-based businesses, one of the most significant—and often overlooked—challenges is involuntary churn caused by failed payments. While many companies focus on acquiring new customers, it’s more profitable to retain the ones you already have. Reducing […]
