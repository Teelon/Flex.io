Remove the largest source of customer churn and dissatisfaction for subscription box customers by applying FlexPay’s AI-powered Invisible Recovery™ solution for failed payments.
![](https://flexpay.io/solutions/subscription-boxes/)
## FlexPay Invisible Recovery™ **Optimizes Failed Payment Recovery for Subscription Box Companies**
Great customer experiences for subscription box customers require uninterrupted service delivery, which is also vital for company growth. One of the biggest drivers of subscriber churn are failed payments. Invisible Recovery™ works quickly and without any subscriber contact requirements, avoiding churn caused by service interruption or from recovery which requires customer engagement.
## Grow subscription revenue by 33%!
Failed credit card payments cause subscriber churn before the natural end of a customer account, which reduces overall company revenue and growth by eliminating multiple payment cycles from completing. High performance failed payment recovery increases subscriber LTV by recovering current month’s payment and unlocking future months billings. . FlexPay allows subscription box customers to choose when they want to end their subscription, and avoid having a failed payment make this decision for them.
Learn how FlexPay subscription box clients experience an average 33% increase in total revenue collected in the first 12 months, and accelerate subscription customer acquisition.
