# FlexPay Partners with Nexio to Deliver Streamlined Payment Recovery Approach
## FlexPay Partners with Nexio to Deliver Streamlined Payment Recovery Approach
Here at FlexPay, we’re focused on helping companies maximize recoveries from failed payments and reduce involuntary churn. And this is one of the many reasons we’re excited to announce our partnership with industry-leading payment management solution [Nexio](https://nex.io). This partnership allows us to support businesses across various verticals, including enterprise-level direct selling companies with recurring payments.
Direct selling companies have complex billing solutions. Auto-ship payments and commission-based structures make revenue attribution from recovered credit card payments challenging to manage. FlexPay’s integration with Nexio enables any clients using their platform to easily add our solution to recover credit card failures and reduce false declines. And FlexPay remedies these billing challenges as our systems work together to identify recovered customers quickly. This helps companies reduce customer churn and increase customer retention.
“Teaming up with Nexio was an easy decision for us. Both of our teams are incredibly passionate about payment processing and the infrastructure that’s required to enhance payment efficiencies and drive value,” comments Chris Reinmuth, EVP of Business Development of FlexPay. 
“Companies face many payment challenges, and with the rise of digital sales and e-commerce, there are more false declines in the payments ecosystem, so tackling these problems together makes us even stronger,” adds Chris.
### Recoup Losses and Recover More Money
The FlexPay team is excited to support Nexio’s clients through our simple integration, which achieves the highest recovery rate in the industry. The recovery rate is a critical measurement to determine the success of your failed payment recovery solution. Even a one percent increase can equate to enormous savings for a company. Another way to put it is, the higher the recovery rate, the more money your business recovers. For clients looking to recoup their losses and keep their customers, partnering with an AI-driven machine learning recovery solution is vital for your business’s growth.
Clients can [contact our experts](https://flexpay.io/contact/) today for more information, and we’ll be happy to answer your questions. Or, you can reach out to your Nexio account representative for more details.
