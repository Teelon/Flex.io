## AGREEMENT
**NOW, THEREFORE** , the Parties agree as follows:
### 1. FP Obligations
  1.     1. **FP Services.** Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, FP will provide Client with the FP Services outlined in the relevant Order Form and Documentation and access to the FlexPay Transaction system;


  1.     1. **FP Customer Support.** Throughout the Term, FP shall provide to Client the appropriate customer support in order to address any identified issues or inaccuracies within a reasonable delay.

      2. provide FP with IS Updates for all FlexPay Transactions;

  1.     1. **Payment Terms.** Client will pay the Fees to FP within the term specified in the Order Form following receipt of invoice, by credit card, wire, electronic funds transfer or ACH deposit, direct withdrawal or any other payment methods reasonably designated by FP. Client understands and agrees that if Client fails to timely pay any FP amount owed to FP under this Agreement, any Order Form or any invoice, then, without limiting FP’s other rights and remedies, FP may immediately suspend provision of and shut off Client’s access to and usage of the FP Services and may suspend all FP’s obligations to Client until any and all past-due amounts are paid in full. Client agrees that FP is not responsible for any damages suffered by Client as a result of Client’s inability to access the FP Services as a result of suspension for non-payment and Client waives any claims related to suspension of FP Services.


If any invoiced amount is not received by FP by the due date, then without limiting FP’s rights or remedies, those amounts may accrue at interest at the lower of (a) 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month or (b) the maximum rate permitted by law. Further, in such instance, FP may accelerate all indebtedness of Client to FP to become immediately due and payable without further notice or demand, which is hereby expressly waived, and FP may condition future renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those otherwise specified in this Agreement or the original Order Form.
  1.     1. **Taxes.** All federal, state, local, value-added, transfer, sales and use taxes arising out of this Agreement will be paid by the Party required to pay such taxes under applicable law.

### 4. Term; Termination.

  1.     1. **Default and Termination.** This Agreement may be terminated at any time as follows: (a) by a Party that has not materially breached or defaulted in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to the Party that has breached or defaulted in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, unless such breaching or defaulting Party has cured or has substantially cured its breaches or defaults within such cure period; (b) immediately upon notice by either Party if the other Party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or arrangement under the bankruptcy laws, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against the other Party, or if a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or any part of the property or assets of the other Party; (c) by a written agreement executed by the Parties; or (d) pursuant to the additional termination provisions in the relevant Order Form, if any.


  1.     1. **Effect of Termination**. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.2, all obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate without liability of any Party to the other Party, except as follows: (a) the provisions of Section 4 and Appendix B will survive termination and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms; (b) if this Agreement is terminated because of a breach of this Agreement by the non-terminating Party, the terminating Party’s right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired; and (c) Client will promptly deliver to FP any Fees due and payable to FP and any other amounts owed to FP under this Agreement, which payment will be due and payable within thirty (30) Business Days after FP’s submission to Client of an invoice for such Fees and other amounts.


  1.     1. **Cancellation Fee.** Client acknowledges and agrees that there will be significant initial integration costs related to the Services provided by FP to Client. Accordingly, if Client terminates before the end of the initial Term outlined in the Order Form, then Client shall pay to FP the early cancellation fee outlined in the relevant Order Form.

### 9. General Provisions.
  1.     1. **Independent Contractors; No Third-Party Beneficiary.** The Parties and their respective personnel are and will be independent contractors and neither Party by virtue of this Agreement will have any right, power or authority to act or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other Party. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties only, and there are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.


  1.     1. **Assignment.** Neither Party may assign any of its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any person or entity, in whole or in part, without the consent of the other Party; provided, however, that either Party may assign this Agreement to a successor of that Party as a result of a merger, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the assets to which this Agreement pertains. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing is void and will be a material breach of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties’ respective successors, heirs and assigns. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8.2, FP may, at its sole and unfettered discretion, assign any of its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any person or entity for any reason whatsoever including but not limited to as a result of a merger, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the assets to which this Agreement pertains.


  1.     1. **Force Majeure.** Neither Party is responsible for delays or failures in performance (other than payment) resulting from acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war and terrorism, embargoes, changes in governmental regulations, epidemics, fire, communication line failures, power failures, earthquakes, and other disasters beyond the reasonable control of such Party (each, a “ _**Force Majeure**_ ”). If a claim by a Party for release of its obligations under this Section exceeds sixty (60) days, then the other Party has the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty of any kind. Neither Party is entitled to relief under this Section to the extent that any event otherwise constituting an event of Force Majeure results from the negligence or fault of such Party or its employees or agents.


  1.     1. **Waiver.** No waiver of any provision hereof or of any right or remedy hereunder will be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party against which such waiver is sought to be enforced. No delay in exercising, no course of dealing with respect to, or no partial exercise of any right or remedy hereunder will constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy, or future exercise thereof.


  1.     1. **Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, it is to that extent to be deemed omitted, and the balance of the Agreement will remain enforceable.

  1.     1. **Amendment.** No amendment, change, waiver, or discharge hereof will be valid unless in writing and signed by both Parties.


  1.     1. **Governing Law; Arbitration and Venue.** The interpretation, validity and enforcement of this Agreement, and all legal actions brought under or in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be governed by the law of the Province of Quebec (except that any conflicts-of-law principles of such state that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction shall be disregarded). Any legal action brought under or in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement or the relationship between the Parties or their owners, management, or agents, that cannot be resolved amicably, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in accordance with the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association or of any similar organization that specializes in the arbitration of commercial business disputes. Client acknowledges and agrees that this venue is reasonable for purposes of uniformity and best meets the interest of FP’s system. Any such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator. Judgement upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof; provided, however, that either Party may seek preliminary injunctive or other equitable relief pending arbitration to prevent irreparable harm. For the limited court proceedings authorized under this Agreement, each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive venue and jurisdiction of the Canadian federal courts or Quebec provincial courts located in Montreal, QC. Each Party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts and agrees not to commence any legal action under or in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement in any other court or forum.


The Parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against any other Party and agree that the Party making any claim directly or indirectly arising from or relating to this Agreement will be limited as outlined in this Agreement. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrator’s expenses and administrative fees of arbitration; however, the prevailing party in any legal action brought by one Party against the other and arising out of this Agreement or the Parties’ relationship shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, to reimbursement for its expenses, including arbitration or court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.
  1.     1. **Pre-Action Dispute Resolution and Mediation.** The Parties agree that they will use their best efforts to amicably resolve any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement by communication and negotiation. If a dispute arises between the Parties, before initiating any formal legal action or proceeding, the Parties shall first cause their primary decision makers to discuss the issue in good faith to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If the dispute has not resolved by informal discussion, before initiating any formal legal action, the parties agree to participate in at least **6** hours of mediation in accordance with the mediation procedures of the American Arbitration Association or of any similar organization that specializes in the mediation of commercial franchise business disputes. The parties agree to equally share the costs of mediation.


  1.     1. **Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and each such executed counterpart will be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such executed counterparts together will constitute one and the same instrument.


  1.     1. **Further Assurances.** Each Party agrees at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, and deliver any further documents and instruments reasonably requested by the other Party, and to take any other action consistent with the terms of this Agreement that may reasonably be requested by the other Party, for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


  1.     1. **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement, together with all Exhibits attached hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of all mutual understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications and understandings, oral or written.


FP shall have the right to reference this Agreement and the identity of the Client in any publicity or marketing campaign to promote its business. FP shall also have the right to make a public announcement/press release concerning the signing of this Agreement with Client so long as FP informs the Client of the contents of the announcement/press release proposed to be made. FP shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain Client’s approval for the announcement/press release, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. Once the content is approved the announcement/press release shall be on a joint basis unless the Client agrees otherwise.
