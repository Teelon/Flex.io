"FlexPay is a great place to work for several reasons, but I will focus on the two that I consider to be most important.
  1. My fellow employees: they are smart, hard-working, and fun to be around. Everyone cares about the quality of their work and are quick to offer support, whenever needed.
  2. Management: culture is very important to the management team, and they actively work to cultivate and maintain it. They are always open to honest feedback from employees and provide an environment where you feel that the work you are doing is directly contributing to the growth of the company."
