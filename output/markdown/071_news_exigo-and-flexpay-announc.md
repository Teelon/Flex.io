# Exigo and FlexPay Announce Strategic Partnership to Help Direct Selling Companies Boost Revenue and Retention
FlexPay, the leader in failed payment recovery, and Exigo, a leading software platform for direct selling and multi-level marketing (MLM) companies, announce [a new partnership enabling seamless recovery of failed credit card payments](https://www.exigo.com/exigo-flexpay-partnership/). This integration helps direct selling businesses increase revenue by retaining customers and the revenue that would otherwise be lost to involuntary churn.
Exigo’s powerful platform provides tools for MLM businesses, including commission management, distributor back-office tools, business analytics, and eCommerce solutions. With the integration of FlexPay’s Invisible Recovery solution, direct selling companies can quickly recapture transactions that have declined without providing visibility of the failed payment to the end customer, which helps them maximize subscriber retention.
_“_ Direct selling companies face unique challenges when it comes to customer retention and failed payments. Integrating FlexPay’s solution into the Exigo platform will allow our clients to not only recover lost revenue but also improve their overall customer experience,” said Rodger Smith, Chief Marketing Officer at Exigo. “This partnership aligns with our mission to provide the best possible tools to help direct selling businesses succeed.”
Through the partnership, Exigo customers can now access FlexPay’s advanced payment recovery solution, which preserves a business’s positive customer experience and helps them avoid the involuntary churn and lost revenue that can occur when the customer is made aware of the failed payment.
Chris Reinmuth, EVP of Business Development at FlexPay, shared his excitement about the collaboration, “We are thrilled to partner with Exigo and bring our payment recovery solution to more direct selling companies. This integration has a tremendous impact on revenue growth and churn reduction for Exigo’s customers. Direct selling companies will benefit from our proven ability to recover failed payments, allowing them to focus on scaling their businesses and enhancing customer relationships.”
